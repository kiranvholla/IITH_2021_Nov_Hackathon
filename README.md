- This is the AS-IS code written on the weekend of 13/14th Nov,2021 as part of FOML (Foundations of Machine Learning) hackathon open across all streams for that year.
- This stood 2nd out of the 241 teams from IITH
- I didnt get a chance to organize the code, however attempted a mild cleanup and added few comments on 14th night just before submission. The code is uploaded to GIT AS-IS. It is in ipynb format.
- The dataset itself is still available on Kaggle at the above link and is has excellent clean data on which additional models can be trained/refined.
